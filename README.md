# PrinciplesPlusPractices
A documentation resource for the principles and practices that I conventionally apply to my software development processes. It is designed to be a helpful, easy-to-read resource for new and experienced developers alike.

In this resource I will recommend many *conventions*, in which conventions are almost never agreed upon in the real-world. As such, understand that this resource is not going to wholy apply to any particular projects, except for mine. However, it will hopefully help you gain some perspective and understanding, and you may even decide to integrate some of these conventions into your own development.

That being said, if you are working on one of my projects, these are the conventions generally expected of you.
